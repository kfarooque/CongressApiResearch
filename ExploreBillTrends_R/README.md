# Congress API Research - Explore Bill Trends (R version)

Explore trends in bills based on data downloaded via ProPublica's Congress API. This uses tab-delimited data based on the JSON files obtained via the API (see the separate project [CongressApi_DownloadResults](https://github.com/kfarooque/CongressApi_DownloadResults)), parses and mines text and data, and generates results and visuals based on identified trends.

*Currently this is in development and the exploration stage, so the methodology and outputs are subject to change.*
